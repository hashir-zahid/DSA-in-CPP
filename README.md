# âš¡ DSA-in-CPP

Welcome to **DSA-in-CPP**, a repository dedicated to practicing and strengthening **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts using **C++**.  
This project is part of my personal learning journey, focusing on writing clean, efficient, and well-structured implementations to enhance problem-solving skills.

## ðŸ“– About This Repository
This repository is **not a complete library** of DSA solutions, but rather a **practice space**.  
It contains selected problems and exercises that Iâ€™ve solved while learning, revising, or experimenting with concepts of:

- âœ… Data Structures  
- âœ… Algorithms  
- âœ… Problem-Solving Strategies  
- âœ… Efficient Coding in C++  

The focus here is on **learning by coding**, rather than building a polished framework.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
The repository is simple and may include:
- Standalone `.cpp` files for different problems.  
- Implementations that highlight a specific concept.  
- No external dependencies (standard C++ only).  

Each file is self-contained and can be compiled/run independently.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### ðŸ”¹ Clone the Repository
- git clone https://github.com/hashir-zahid/DSA-in-CPP.git
- cd DSA-in-CPP

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals of This Repo
ðŸ“Œ Strengthen understanding of DSA concepts.
ðŸ“Œ Practice writing efficient C++ code.
ðŸ“Œ Build a personal reference for revision and interview prep.
ðŸ“Œ Develop consistency in solving problems.

### ðŸŒŸ Why This Repo?
- Itâ€™s a practice-oriented project, not a framework.
- Focuses on clarity and learning rather than perfection.
- Can serve as a reference point for myself (and others) revisiting DSA concepts.- 
- Easy to extend by adding more problems in the future.


### ðŸ™Œ Contributing
This is primarily a personal practice repo, but contributions are welcome! 

You can:
- Open issues for suggestions.
- Submit pull requests with improvements.
- Share ideas for better approaches.

### ðŸ’¡ Final Note
- This repository is part of my continuous journey of exploring Data Structures and Algorithms in C++.
- Itâ€™s small now but will grow with time and practice.
